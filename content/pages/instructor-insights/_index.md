Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course 11.124 _Introduction to Education: Looking Forward and Looking Back on Education_ as it was taught in Fall 2011 by Professor Erik Klopfer. Most content on this page also applies to the course [11.125 _Introduction to Education: Understanding and Evaluating Education_](/courses/11-125-introduction-to-education-understanding-and-evaluating-education-spring-2009/).

This course is an introductory course on teaching and learning science and mathematics in a variety of K-12 settings. Topics include education and media, education reform, the history of education, simulations, games, and the digital divide. This course is required for the [Scheller Teacher Education Program (STEP)](https://education.mit.edu/) at MIT, through which students can earn a teaching license.

The Classroom
-------------

*   ![In this medium-sized classroom, six rows of seats are visible. Each row has six to seven chairs with attached desks. At the front, there is a small table and two columns of sliding chalkboards.](/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-124-introduction-to-education-looking-forward-and-looking-back-on-education-fall-2011/instructor-insights/11-124_classroom-1.png)

Student Information
-------------------

![On average, about 25 students take this course each year.](/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-124-introduction-to-education-looking-forward-and-looking-back-on-education-fall-2011/instructor-insights/11-124_stat-students.png)

### Breakdown by Degree Program

All undergraduate students, mostly sophomores and juniors.

### Breakdown by Major

Varies

### Typical Student Background

*   Strong background in science and math, as is typical of MIT students
*   Interested in education

### Enrollment Cap

Student interest in the [Scheller Teacher Education Program (STEP)](http://education.mit.edu/classes/overview), including 11.124, has grown significantly in the past decade alongside increasing interest in education and social issues among the overall MIT student population. For 11.124 in particular, enrollment has surged, with 60-70 students trying to enroll in the Fall 2012 offering. A decade earlier, the course instructors had to advertise extensively to gather a class of 20 students. The class is capped at 25 students due to CI-H limitations. Students are selected based on interest in education, interest in the full STEP program, and seniority.

### Ideal Class Size

About 25 students. In past classes with 12-14 students, there wasn’t enough diversity of opinion; in past classes with 32-35 students, it was difficult for everyone to be an active part of class discussions.
